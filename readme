Ocaml build from the people's front of cat-v.org

This is still a work in progress. Current status is that the ocaml runtime
vm is built, ocamlyacc is built, and the ocaml std library is built.

To build with this, get a recent ocaml from here https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/releases
and untar it somewhere. Then dircp this repo into that untarred directory.

Then you can go into the byterun, yacc, and stdlib directories and use mk
to build and install ocaml components.

I will try to keep this readme updated as I make progress. All that is left
is the compiler itself. If you have already built ocaml byte code programs on
another OS, then you should already be able to run them on plan 9 with the
ocamlrun runtime.
